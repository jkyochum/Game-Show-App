Word Guessing Game / treehouse project 6

This is a word-guessing game. Players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in the phrase. A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. At that point, the same puzzle is shown to give the player another chance. Letters guessed correctly will appear in the phrase. Letters guessed incorrectly will be counted at the bottom of the screen.
